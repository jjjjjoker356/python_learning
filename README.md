A simple spider for www.pornpics.com

pics_spider.py is the origin version of the spider.
multithreading_pornpics_downloader.py is the multi thread version of the pics_spider.py, which allows you search download
different models with multi threads. I hope it can accerlerate the script but I haven't test it.

By the way, it supposed to download 3000 images for each person if the resources are enough, and you can adjust the quantity 
by change the param "total" in (SPIDER.) download_album_url.
